          <h2>Types of cryogenic plants</h2>
          <div className="item-container">
            <h3>Cryogenic oxygen and nitrogen plants</h3>
            <p>
              Cryogenic plants, designed to obtain oxygen and nitrogen, possess
              distinct characteristics that set them apart from other types of
              gas plant constructions. Here are the key points to consider:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Composition of Atmospheric Air: The primary components of
                atmospheric air are oxygen and nitrogen, with traces of other
                gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, argon, or helium.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compressed Air Generation: Multi-stage compressors are used to
                draw in atmospheric air and compress it to obtain compressed
                air. Inter-coolers, moisture separators, and industrial
                refrigerators are employed to eliminate carbon dioxide,
                moisture, and hydrocarbons. This process leads to the formation
                of a Molecular Sieve Battery.
              </li>
              <li>
                Separation of Nitrogen and Oxygen: Heat exchangers facilitate
                the separate paths of nitrogen and oxygen. Oxygen is compressed
                and directly filled into cylinders, while nitrogen requires a
                high-pressure compressor to complete the process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cooling and Air Routes: The purified air is then cooled using
                nitrogen and oxygen. It can follow two routes: a portion passes
                through a second heat exchanger, while another part goes through
                an Expansion Engine to generate additional cooling.
              </li>
              <li>
                Air Release: An expansion valve is responsible for releasing the
                air that has undergone liquefaction.
              </li>
              <li>
                Separation of Oxygen and Nitrogen: The process of separating
                oxygen and nitrogen involves distillation using a fractional
                column. This column is comprised of two sections, namely the
                lower and upper parts, with a condenser positioned in between.
                Pure nitrogen ascends to the top of the upper column, while
                oxygen remains at the bottom.

                Preliminary Analysis: Understanding Client Needs To kick-start
                the design process, we begin with a preliminary analysis. Our
                team of engineers conducts a comprehensive study to fully
                understand the requirements and needs of the client. This stage
                is essential as it forms the foundation for the subsequent
                design decisions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Design Phase: Calculations and Drafting Building upon the
                preliminary analysis, our engineers proceed with the design
                phase. Through our drafting department, they undertake all the
                necessary finite element calculations to ensure the project's
                safety and compliance with the highest quality standards. This
                stage involves careful consideration of various factors, such as
                structural integrity and functional requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                2D and 3D Visualization: Bringing the Design to Life Once the
                calculations are completed, our drafting department transforms
                the design into a visual representation. Using advanced
                software, they create detailed 2D and 3D models of the entire
                plant. This enables stakeholders to virtually visualize the
                plant's appearance, allowing for accurate assessment of
                dimensions and aesthetics.
              </li>
              <li>
                Study of Necessary Elements and Compliance with Regulations To
                ensure the plant's success, our engineering department conducts
                a comprehensive study. This study involves determining all the
                necessary elements for the plant, including equipment and
                accessories. Additionally, it addresses the stringent
                regulations imposed by the industry. Our team meticulously
                analyzes and incorporates solutions to meet these regulations,
                ensuring compliance throughout the design process.

              <li>
                Continuous Communication and Guidance Throughout the entire
                design process, close collaboration between the engineering
                department and the drafting team is crucial. Constant
                communication ensures that guidance is provided, maintaining the
                design's quality and safety. This collaboration allows for the
                seamless integration of ideas, expertise, and feedback,
                resulting in an optimized and well-executed design.
