          <h2>Types of Gaztron’s Air Dryers</h2>
          <div className="item-container">
            <div className="dryer">
              <h3>1. Refrigerated Type Air Dryer</h3>
              <p>
                Gaztron’s refrigerated air dryer is the prevailing choice for
                drying compressed air and utility gases in various industrial
                applications, such as drying plant air, seal gas, hydrogen gas
                for generator cooling, and nitrogen gas drying. It is widely
                utilized due to its ability to maintain an acceptable dew point
                of +2°C at line pressure, which corresponds to a dew point of
                -22°C at atmospheric pressure.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="dryer">
              <h3>2. Heatless Type Air Dryer</h3>
              <p>
                Gaztron’s Our heatless dryer design incorporates two vessels
                that are filled with desiccant, ensuring a continuous cycle that
                produces dry air. In this process, the wet air enters the bottom
                of one vessel and travels upwards through the desiccant bed,
                where the moisture is adsorbed. The dry air exits from the top
                of the vessel. Simultaneously, a small portion of the dry air is
                directed downward through the desiccant bed in the second
                vessel, which undergoes re-generation. The moisture-laden purge
                air is then vented out to the atmosphere, resulting in a purge
                loss equivalent to approximately 7.5% of the total air flow. At
                regular intervals, the vessels automatically switch over,
                ensuring a seamless transition and continuous availability of
                dry air without any sudden fluctuations.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="dryer">
              <h3>3. Heat Reactivated Type Air Dryer</h3>
              <p>
                Heat reactivated dryers are employed when extremely low dew
                points of -60°C or -80°C are required for compressed air. In
                this particular design, the desiccant is regenerated at elevated
                temperatures, accompanied by a small amount of dry air purge. By
                utilizing dry air purging and thermal regeneration, the residual
                moisture loading on the desiccant is minimized, resulting in
                remarkably low dew points being achieved.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="dryer">
              <h3>4. Heat of Compression (HOC) Type Air Dryer</h3>
              <p>
                Gaztron's Heat of Compression (HOC) Type Air Dryer offers highly
                efficient drying capabilities for compressed air systems. This
                advanced technology ensures that the compressed air is dried to
                an extremely low dew point, providing exceptional dryness. With
                the HOC design, the heat generated during the compression
                process is utilized for regeneration, eliminating the need for
                external energy sources. This not only enhances energy
                efficiency but also reduces operating costs.

              <h3>5. No Purge Loss Type Air Dryers</h3>
              <p className="m-0">
                Leveraging our extensive industry expertise, we provide a
                diverse selection of No Purge Loss Type Air Dryers. These dryers
                are specifically designed to eliminate water vapor from
                compressed air without any loss of the compressed air itself.
                Our range encompasses various capacities, pressure ratings, and
                dew point options, catering to the specific needs of our
                clients. To ensure optimal performance and flawless operation,
                each dryer undergoes rigorous testing on well-defined
