                    <h2>The operational principle of the Ammonia Cracker Purifier Unit </h2>
                    <div className="details">
                        <p>                    The Ammonia Cracker Purifier Unit is employed downstream of the Ammonia Cracker Unit to eliminate un-cracked Ammonia and moisture. It consists of two vessels filled with Molecular Sieves. One vessel operates in the purification cycle while the other undergoes regeneration. The cycle time can be adjusted as per requirements. The Molecular Sieves effectively remove un-cracked Ammonia and moisture. To control the process, a 3-Way inlet valve and a 3-Way outlet valve, along with two 2-Way valves for exhaust lines, are installed between the two drying towers. These valves automatically open and close according to a preset timer.
                        </p>
                        <p>During the regeneration process of the Molecular Sieves, they are heated to a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius. The high temperature causes the moisture and Ammonia absorbed in the Molecular Sieves to be released along with dry cracked gas. After regeneration, the bed is allowed to cool naturally to reach ambient temperature. Temperature Indicators are provided in the Molecular Sieve Towers to monitor these conditions. The dry and purified cracked gas then passes through a Rota meter before entering the system.
